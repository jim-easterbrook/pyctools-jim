Pyctools-Jim
============

Miscellaneous Pyctools_ components.

This package contains a variety of Pyctools_ components I have developed for my own experiments and which aren't really general enough (or good enough) to be included in the main Pyctools package.

Requirements
------------

* Pyctools_ and its requirements.

Installation
------------

You should clone the GitHub repository, or download and extract a zip or tar.gz archive from the GitHub releases page, and then use ``setup.py`` to install the components::

  git clone https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/pyctools-jim.git
  cd pyctools-jim
  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Use
---

Installation will add some extra components you can import into your Pyctools scripts or use via the Pyctools editor program.
